### Synopsis:

BoopSuite is a wireless testing suite with extensible and independent components.

Need to hop wireless channels?         ... ‚úÖ

Need to only work with beacon packets? ... ‚úÖ

Need to Monitor Deauth requests?       ... ‚úÖ

### The suite mimics flask!

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import boop
import time

app = boop.BoopSniff(boop.WIRELESS_DEVICES[0])
app.packets = 0

@app.handler(boop.MGMT_DEAUTH)
def pkt(self, p):
    self.packets += 1
    return

@app.handler(boop.MGMT_BEACON)
def pkt(self, p):
    self.packets += 1
    return

@app.printer()
def printa(self):
    while True:
        print(self.packets)
        time.sleep(5)

app.run()

```

Import the modules you need, add handlers for the packets you want and parse away.

List of fill packet types:

* MGMT_ASSOC_REQ
* MGMT_ASSOC_RESP
* MGMT_REASSOC_REQ
* MGMT_REASSOC_RESP
* MGMT_PROBE_REQ
* MGMT_PROBE_RESP
* MGMT_BEACON
* MGMT_ATIM
* MGMT_DISASSOC
* MGMT_AUTH
* MGMT_DEAUTH
* CTRL_POLL
* CTRL_RTS
* CTRL_CTS
* CTRL_ACK
* CTRL_CFEND
* CTRL_CFECFA
* DATA_ANY

### Note:

I use this project personally for my wireless endeavours,
feel free to use, modify and extend.

# Requirements:

+ python3
+ everything in the requirements.txt

# Installation:

#### To install open a terminal and type:

```
pip3 install boop
```

# Motivation:

I am motivated by the want to be better. To prove others wrong and to prove
to myself that I can do things that were previously impossible to me.

# In Progress:

+ Code Fixes will be happening.
+ More functional API and better imports
+ recreating the old boopsuite sniffer in the __main__ file
+ argparsing for said file
